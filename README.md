# Identifying Key Drivers of Home Loan Dashboard Using Power BI

This project focuses on identifying the key drivers influencing home loan approvals for amounts exceeding ₹10 Lakh. The goal is to explore the relationships between applicant demographics, financial status, and credit history to determine which factors contribute to securing higher loan amounts.

# Dataset Overview

The dataset includes comprehensive applicant information with the following columns (assumed):

**Applicant Demographics:** Gender, marital status, number of dependents, and education.

**Financial Information:** Applicant and co-applicant income, loan amount, loan term, and property area.

**Credit and Loan History:** Credit score, previous loan history, and loan repayment status.


# Project Goals

**Understand Key Influences:** Identify the primary factors that impact the approval of loan amounts exceeding ₹10 Lakh.

**Visualize Insights:** Develop interactive Power BI dashboards to analyze loan patterns and applicant profiles.

**Enhance Loan Approval Strategies:** Provide actionable recommendations to improve decision-making and reduce risks associated with high-value loans.


 # Key Insights from the Analysis

**1. Loan Amount vs Income:**

- A strong positive correlation between applicant income and loan amount suggests that higher-income applicants are more likely to secure larger loan amounts.

- Co-applicant income also plays a role in increasing eligibility for high-value loans.


**2. Impact of Credit History:**

- Applicants with a higher credit score (typically 700+) show a higher likelihood of obtaining loan amounts exceeding ₹10 Lakh.

- Poor credit history often leads to loan rejections or smaller approved amounts.


**3. Loan Approval by Property Area:**

- Urban applicants are more likely to secure higher loan amounts, while semi-urban and rural applicants have lower success rates for large loans.

- This highlights a potential focus area for expanding lending opportunities in non-urban regions.


** 4. Influence of Marital and Dependent Status:**

- Married applicants with fewer dependents tend to secure higher loan amounts due to lower financial obligations.

- Single applicants often qualify for smaller loans due to perceived financial risk.


**5. Loan Term and Repayment Behavior:**

- Longer loan terms increase the likelihood of approving higher loan amounts but come with higher overall repayment risk.

- Default rates are higher among applicants opting for longer repayment periods.


# Visualization Insights

The data was visualized through Power BI dashboards to explore:

- Distribution of loan amounts and approval rates.
  
- Correlation between income, credit score, and approved loan amounts.
  
- Regional analysis of high-value loan approvals.


# Business Impact

These insights can help financial institutions improve their loan approval processes by:

- Prioritizing applicants with high credit scores and stable incomes.
  
- Expanding lending opportunities in semi-urban and rural areas.
  
- Refining approval criteria to reduce default risks on high-value loans.
